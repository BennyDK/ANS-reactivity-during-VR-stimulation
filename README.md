This package allows reaserchers to process GSR, ECG, and respiration raw data, to calculate "stress score" and visualize it.
We offer tools for visualizing the "stress score" changes over time, either offline or online during data aquisition.
In addition, this package allows to process speech data, and show correlational data to the other metrics.
